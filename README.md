Unfortunately, GitHub seems to have issues for previewing HTML files directly in repositories so I had to append the following text to my html file in my repository in order to have my html file view properly: http://htmlpreview.github.com/?

Thank you to the author of the following site for explaining this in greater detail:

Also many thanks to Rodney Slagle's post in the Course 9-week 2 online forums for explaining the proper way to call the html file:
